# Polkadot - from scratch

In this section, you will learn about Polkadot from scratch.

Polkadot is an open-source and next-gen blockchain protocol that helps to  connect multiple blockchains. It helps to build our customizable blockchains in  the Polkadot network. It is a project of Web3 Foundation from Zug, the crypto valley of Switzerland,  and later contracted by UK-based Parity technologies to develop and maintain  the Polkadot network. Dr.Gavin Wood co-founded the Polkadot project, an former CTO and one of the original co-founders of the Ethereum Foundation. He is also the CEO of Parity  Technologies. The official whitepaper was launched in 2016 and made a successful $145  million fundraising in 2017. 

And finally, Polkadot went with its mainnet on  May 26, 2020. It has a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus  mechanism. The native cryptocurrency for Polkadot is DOT, which serves three main  purposes: network governance, operation, and bonding. Infrastructure:- The Infrastructure of the Polkadot blockchain makes it "Unique" from other  blockchains. Polkadot is a Layer 0 Blockchain, and it is the most foundational  architecture that acts as the support of layer one chains. Shortly, it provides a  platform to build layer one blockchains on Polkadot network. The essential parts of the Polkadot Blockchain are the Relay chain,  Parathreads, Parachains, and Bridges. These are the pillars for Polkadot  Blockchain. Relay chain:- The Relay Chain is the primary chain used by the Polkadot  network. 

It is also called the "Heart of Polkadot Network" for its security,  consensus, and cross-chain interoperability. The relay chain is one mechanism  upon which many verifiable data structures can be hosted, called parallelized  chains or parachains. 

Parachains:- Parachains are blockchains that run independently and run on  the relay chain. Each parachain will have a specialized purpose in the network. 

Parathreads:- Parathreads are much similar and an alternative to parachains.  Parathreads act as temporary participation (on a block-by-block basis) in the  relay chain for Polkadot security before purchasing an expensive parachain  slot.

Bridges:- Bridges are designed to make a relay between parachains on their  networks and also need to create bridges on other blockchains like Bitcoin,  Ethereum, and more. It helps to transfer the tokens inside the network and  outside of different blockchains. 

Reasons for becoming a game changer:- Polkadot currently has $7 Billion of market value and holds the 11th position, according to coinmarketcap. The total supply of DOT is 1.22billion DOT, and  the circulating collection is 1.11billion DOT. There are many good technical reasons present in this blockchain to become a  game changer in the future. 

1) Polkadot blockchain is one of the mostimportant blockchains in the  blockchain space because it has a vast ecosystem like DeFi, Layer 1 and Layer 2  blockchains, wallets, and DAOs. 
2)In Polkadot, we can build blockchains with particular purposes like the Smart  contract platform, DAO, DeFi / DEX, Oracle, etc. 
3) Rust is the primary language, and the main tool for building a blockchain in  the Polkadot network is Substrate. It is a framework developed to create our  blockchains or customize blockchains. 
4)Polkadot tries to solve the scalability and interoperability in blockchain space.  That's why they developed multichain or cross-chain, a chain that helps to  connect other networks in their network and connects other blockchains like  Solana, Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. 
5) The Relay chain shares equal security with all participating blockchains. That  results, most of the blockchains received the place to perform well the same the  expenses of security for blockchains will decrease. The smart contracts  developed by Substrate and rust are much safer than Solidity smart contracts. 
6) It provided a place where all parachains can interact so that they can be built  several dApps within the same platform with no scalability problems. 
7) Nowadays, the developers and the products from Polkadot are increasing.  The growth of Polkadot is rising day by day. That results in it getting one of the  top blockchains by development activities. 
8) Recently, Polkadot focused on dApps development and GameFi in their  ecosystem. The dApp network like Moonbeam and Acala Networks grows  dynamically. 
9) Compared to other blockchains, Polkadot helps to build a blockchain easily  by using a substrate framework. Polkadot is an open-source project, and it makes the blockchain environment  accessible, scalable, decentralized, and secure at a high level. 

It was launched in  2020 but showed dynamic growth in all sectors, like DeFi, DAO, Web3, and  much more.
